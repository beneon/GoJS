  <p>
  This sample is exactly like the <a href="doubleTree.html">Double Tree</a> sample,
  but this gets its data by getting JSON content from the server.
  In this case the data is in a static file named <a href="doubleTree.json" target="_blank">doubleTree.json</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  This sample displays a diagram of two trees sharing a single root node growing in opposite directions.
  The immediate child data of the ROOT node have a "dir" property
  that describes the direction that subtree should grow.
  </p>
  <p>
  Unlike many <b>GoJS</b> apps, there is no <a>Diagram.layout</a> assigned.
  Layouts are performed in code -- a separate <a>TreeLayout</a> for each subtree.
  Each tree layout works on a subset of the nodes.
  The <b>separatePartsByLayout</b> function produces two separate collections of Nodes and Links,
  one for each direction, and thus one for each tree layout.
